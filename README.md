# Boosting

  *  SFrames to do some feature engineering.
  *  Modified decision trees to incorporate weights.
  *  Adaboost ensembling.
  *  My implementation of Adaboost to train a boosted decision stump ensemble.
  *  Evaluate the effect of boosting (adding more decision stumps) on performance of the model.
  *  Explore the robustness of Adaboost to overfitting.
